The couch was just our living room couch. It felt lonely in there. But we set it free.

## 1: create 2 mobile platforms and fix them to the couch.
We bought 2 electric wheelchairs. We remove the top of the wheelchairs to keep only the base. We stack 3 layers of plywood to get a 2.5 inches thick wooden surface. We screw 2 elbowed steel bars into each plywood surface. We use metal screws to fix the surfaces to the wheelchairs. This makes 2 platforms that can carry a lot of weight. We mount the couch on top of the platform, and we screw the couch to the plywood extensively. The platforms are a bit wider than the couch so we can mount a sound system and additional batteries on the back. 

## 2: power it up
Each wheelchair is powered with 2 batteries 12V Lead-Acid mounted in series. We control them in differential drive using a raspberry Pi and the wheelchair control ports. On top of the engine's batteries, we add 2 additional 12V Lead-Acid batteries at the back of the couch. One battery powers up an extensive amount of lights: LEDs at the back, two headlights at the front. The other one powers up the sound system. These batteries are isolated from the outside with a plastic cover.

Exciting, right? Now we can look like it's a Tuesday 8pm and we're watching TV, except that we're at Burning Man and we're watching a beautiful sunset.
